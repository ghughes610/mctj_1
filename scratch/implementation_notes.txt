when you enter number of circuits we should only make those
    the user shouldnt have to answer this 
    add a number of workouts for a circuit too 


generate work set button 

    if you have that exercise
        it will look at the average weight and reps of each exercise
    if not you will gen the default weight and reps


I am making a map out of the template exercise
    make columns match on template exercise and exercise table
    need to make this into an exercise (add workout id)
