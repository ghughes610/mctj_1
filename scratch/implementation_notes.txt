need to save an exercise like this 
    "1":[exercise, exercise_1]
right now they are saving like this
    nil:[exercise, exercise_1]
where am i setting the key to nil?
 in workouts.sort_exercise_workouts

solution
i need to save the exercise with a circuit key in its metadata


I am making a map out of the template exercise
    make columns match on template exercise and exercise table
    need to make this into an exercise (add workout id)
